  <Description>+++ Run Mozilla Thunderbird as a portable app +++

Make email easier with Thunderbird, a free email application that's easy to set up and customize. It's loaded with great features, bringing together speed, privacy and the latest technologies.

Furthermore the Lightning Calender Integration helps you organize your schedule and life's important events. Manage multiple calenders, create your daily to do list, invite friends to events and subscripe to public calenders.

◆ Mail Account Setup Wizard ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Prior to this feature you had to know your IMAP, SMTP, and SSL/TLS settings. Now all you need to provide is your name, email address, and password and the email account set up wizardry will check our database and find the email settings for you.

◆ One-click Address Book ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One-click Address Book is a quick and easy way to add people to your address book. Add people by simply clicking on the star icon in the message you receive. Two clicks and you can add more details like a photo, birthday, and other contact information.

◆ Attachment Reminder ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The attachment reminder looks for the word attachment (and other words like file types) in the body of your message and reminds you to add an attachment before hitting send.

◆ Tabbed Email ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you like Firefox’s tabbed browsing, you’re going to love tabbed email. Tabbed email lets you load emails in separate tabs so you can quickly jump between them. Perhaps you’re responding to an email and need to refer back to an earlier email. Tabbed email lets you keep multiple emails open for easy reference.

When quitting Thunderbird, visible tabs will be saved and will be restored when you open Thunderbird the next time. There is also a Tab menu on the Tab toolbar to help you switch between Tabs.

◆ Quick Filter Toolbar ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Quick Filter Toolbar lets you filter your email faster. Start typing in words in the Quick Filter search box and the results are displayed instantly. Or you can filter your email by New Messages, Tags, and people in your Address Book. You can also "Pin" or save a Filter and use it across multiple folders.

◆ Search Tools ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The search interface in Thunderbird contains filtering and timeline tools to pinpoint the exact email you’re looking for. Thunderbird also indexes all of your emails and chat conversations to help you search even faster. Your search results are displayed in a tab so you can easily switch back and forth to your search results and other email.

◆ Message Archive ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you think you’re going to need an email in the future but want it out of your inbox without deleting it, archive it! Archiving helps you manage your inbox and put your email into the archive folder system.

◆ Thunderbird Look &amp; Feel ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Themes allow you to change the look of Thunderbird in an instant. Working on getting to inbox zero at night? Turn on the dark theme to make managing your email easier on the eyes. Thunderbird ships with both light and dark themes, and more are available as add-ons.

◆ Smart Folders ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Smart Folders help you manage multiple email accounts by combining special folders like your Inbox, Sent, or Archive folder. Instead of going to the Inbox for each of your mail accounts, you can see all of your incoming email in one Inbox folder.

◆ Add-ons Manager ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Find and install add-ons directly in Thunderbird. You no longer need to visit the add-ons Web site - instead simply fire up the Add-ons Manager. Not sure which add-on is right for you? Ratings, recommendations, descriptions and pictures of the add-ons in action help you make your selection.

◆ Robust Privacy ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thunderbird offers support for user privacy and remote image protection. To ensure a user’s privacy, Thunderbird automatically blocks remote images in email messages.

◆ Phishing Protection ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thunderbird protects you from email scams which try to trick users into handing over personal and confidential information by indicating when a message is a potential phishing attempt. As a second line of defense, Thunderbird warns you when you click on a link which appears to be taking you to a different Web site than the one indicated by the URL in the message.

◆ Cutting Out the Junk ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thunderbird’s popular junk mail tools have been updated to stay ahead of spam. Each email you receive passes through Thunderbird’s leading-edge junk mail filters. Each time you mark messages as spam, Thunderbird "learns" and improves its filtering so you can spend more time reading the mail that matters. Thunderbird can also use your mail provider’s spam filters to keep junk mail out of your inbox. 

◆ Open Source ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~
At the heart of Thunderbird is an open source development process driven by thousands of passionate, experienced developers and security experts spread all over the world. Our openness and active community of experts helps to ensure our products are more secure and quickly updated, while also enabling us to take advantage of the best third party security scanning and evaluation tools to further bolster overall security.
