 Programs who are in BETA or ALPHA or WIP status have not been tested properly and may be unstable. Programs who are V1.0 or above is tested and should be quite robust. However I can't guarantee this. Most of the programs are written for my own purpose and because of that I do my best to make them as robust as possible. As most user's I don't like when programs crash and/or destroy important data so I can assure you that I have tried to think of all possible things that can go wrong and made extra effort to check for, and if possible correct bad input. This software is freeware so you don't have to pay anything to use it, however if you make your own software or music I would appreciate a free copy or license. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions, requests or other suggestions ;)
