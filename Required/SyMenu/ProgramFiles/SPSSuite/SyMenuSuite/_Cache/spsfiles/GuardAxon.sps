  <Description>GuardAxon is a free program that is used to encrypt and decrypt files e.g. 
for safe transmission or transportation on removable media. The program uses 
the following encryption algorithms: BlowFish, Twofish, DES, 3DES, AES-128, 
AES-192, AES-256. Selecting files to protection is very simple because 
GuardAxon uses the classic file manager. The program can generate reports 
in PDF format at the end of the encryption / decryption. GuardAxon also allows you to calculate and verify the checksum of files (CRC32, MD-5, SHA1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256).</Description>
