  <Description>+++ Public Test Build of the VoIP app Discord +++

The Public Test Build is the beta version of the Discord Client and the middle ground between the Stable and Canary clients. The Public Test Build (PTB) sometimes has features that are not available on Stable. The PTB is intended to be a way for users to help Discord test new features, so it can be expected that PTB is less stable than the main client.

Discord is a proprietary freeware application and communication service for voice, video and text used by over a hundred million people to talk with their friends and communities. Today it's used far beyond its initial purpose as a gaming community client.

Therefor Discord servers are organized into topic-based channels where you can collaborate, share and just talk about whatever you decide to. Get a community of any size running with moderation tools and custom member access. Give members special powers, set up private channels and more.

Low-latency voice and video feels like youâ€™re in the same room. Wave hello over video, watch friends stream their games, or gather up and have a drawing session with screen share.
