  <Description>+++ Run Mozilla Firefox as a portable app +++

Firefox Browser is a fast, powerful and secure web browser that supports open standards and many of the latest web technologies. The program includes smart search, easy bookmark management, web development tools and a built-in download manager.

◆ File that bookmark ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Get your favourites all sorted with the bookmark star icon, which lets you add custom names and folders quickly. Then add in your bookmarks toolbar to make sure you never lose sight of the links you love.

◆ Fly with that bookmark ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Take your favourites on the fly. Use Firefox Sync to access your bookmarks across all your devices, from desktop to mobile. Or try Pocket to save any online article, or page and come back to later – even without internet.

◆ Speed up your computer ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Every computer program you run takes up some memory. When too much is used, your system can slooooowww down. Firefox aims for a balance — using enough memory to let you browse smoothly and leaving plenty of memory to keep your computer responsive.

◆ Stop running out of memory ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chrome uses up to 1.77x more memory than Firefox. If your computer is already low on memory, this can cause a significant slowdown. Using Firefox’s latest version with multi-process can result in more available memory to run your favourite programs.

◆ Browse faster, privately ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Explore the web faster with Firefox Private Browsing. Only Firefox’s private mode includes tracking protection which blocks ads with trackers from loading on pages. De-cluttering sites means web pages can load faster.

◆ Browse without a trace ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sharing is caring, but that should be your call. Firefox Private Browsing automatically erases your online info like passwords, cookies and history from your computer. So that when you close out, you leave no trace. 

◆ Catch those hidden trackers ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some web sites and ads attach hidden trackers that collect your browsing info long after you’ve left. Only Firefox Private Browsing has tracking protection to block them automatically.

◆ Shake off tracking weight ◆
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Not only do trackers collect info, they can weigh down your browsing speeds. Only Firefox Private Browsing blocks ads with hidden trackers, so you can drop the baggage and browse freely.

This portable version of the app is made by Portapps, Inc., an open source project, self-funded &amp; developed by CrazyMax, an experienced developer of open source software.

Compared to the original release, following modifications have been made through policies to ensure portability:

  -&gt; Multilingual: All languages included (app\langs) &amp; available in yml-config
  -&gt; Disable updater : Firefox Developer Edition updates are turned off
  -&gt; Don’t check default browser : Stops checking at startup
  -&gt; ‘Know your rights’: Don’t show on first run
  -&gt; WhatsNew: Don’t show on first run after every update
  -&gt; Profile: Profile path is overwritten to data\profile folder (see below).
  -&gt; Created Shortcut (launch) allows native notifications (removed closing)

The documentation, an overview of all portable applications published by Portapps, as well as the posibility to submit a request if your favourite app is missing, are available at https://portapps.io/.

Big Thanks to CrazyMax! IMHO this is worth at least a star (or some more) at github, or maybe also a small donation to support future development.</Description>
